# `label-gen`

> Generate string labels based on connected USB devices.

Jenkins labels are strings that help characterize the features of a given
executor node. It is quite burdensome and error prone to manually annotate
nodes with attached USB devices. `label-gen` hopes to automate this process
by automatically determining what the labels for a particular node should be.
